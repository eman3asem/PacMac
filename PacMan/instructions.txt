Pac-man istruction:
 Pac-Man was one of the very interesting games developed around 1980. 
- Move Pac-Man: Pac-Man starts at the bottom of the maze. 
Move him by swiping towards the direction you want him to turn. 
If you want to move him up, swipe up. If you want to turn him left, 
swipe left. Pac-Man will start moving. If you have the game sounds on, 
you can hear the classic chomping sound as Pac-Man moves through 
the maze.
- Avoid ghosts: Avoid the different colored ghosts in the maze. 
Once you hit one, you lose one of you lives.
- Immunity: when pac-man eats big dots you get immunity and 
you can eat ghosts 
- Eat Pac-dots: The maze is filled with Pac-dots and pickups 
for Pac-Man to eat. Your score is based on the number of dots 
you eat in the game before getting hit by the glitch or a ghost. 
Move Pac-Man across the maze and eat as many Pac-dots as possible.
- Eat fruits: Aside from the Pac-dots, there are a few 
fruits scattered on the maze. These fruits will multiply 
your scores. When you see one, see if you can eat it without 
risking getting eaten by ghosts.
- Small dots boost the score by 10
- Big dots boost the score by 50 and gives you immunity
- fruits gives you one extra life
- fire boosts the score by 100.
- Ghosts boost the score by 200 during immunity.
- Beat your best score: Continue playing and beat your 
highest score. The further up the maze you go, the more 
Pac-dots you can eat, and the more points you get. Eating 
the fruits and the ghosts will also increase your score. 
Your score is displayed at the top part of the maze as you 
play.
- Control sounds: you can trun on or off the sounds in the
game.
